# RestaurantAI Sales Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our go-to-market strategy for converting independent restaurants into paying customers through a 2-week free trial. Our target: high-volume phone order restaurants suffering from missed calls, labor shortages, and inconsistent order accuracy.

---

## Target Market Analysis

### Tier 1: Primary Targets (Highest Priority)

#### 1. Independent Pizza Restaurants
**Why they're ideal:**
- Pizza has the highest phone order volume in the restaurant industry
- Phone orders represent a major revenue channel—every missed call is a lost sale
- 70% of pizza customers prefer ordering online/phone for delivery
- Average order values are 18% higher on phone orders with proper upselling
- Industry revenue has contracted 2.9% annually—operators need efficiency gains

**Pain points we solve:**
- Missed calls during dinner rush (typically 8-10 simultaneous calls)
- Inconsistent upselling (AI suggests add-ons consistently—one customer saw 23% revenue increase)
- High turnover (80% annual rate) means constant retraining on order taking
- Labor costs rising (92% of operators report increases)

**Decision maker:** Owner-operator (usually works the business daily)

**Ideal profile:**
- Single-location pizzeria
- $500K-$2M annual revenue
- Currently using basic phone system or cell phone
- High delivery/takeout mix (60%+ of revenue)
- Located in suburban or urban residential areas

---

#### 2. Chinese Takeout Restaurants
**Why they're ideal:**
- Takeout-first business model (often 80%+ takeout)
- High call volume, especially during dinner hours
- Owners are hands-on and make quick decisions
- Language barriers can make phone orders challenging—AI handles clearly
- Often understaffed with family-run operations

**Pain points we solve:**
- Missed calls while cooking/prepping
- Order accuracy issues from phone miscommunication
- No time to answer phones during rush
- Customer frustration from busy signals

**Decision maker:** Owner (usually family patriarch/matriarch)

**Ideal profile:**
- Family-owned operation
- High takeout percentage
- Limited front-of-house staff
- Busy residential neighborhood location

---

#### 3. Wings & Chicken Restaurants
**Why they're ideal:**
- Extreme call volume spikes during sports events
- Game days create predictable but unmanageable phone traffic
- Takeout-heavy business model
- Young, tech-receptive customer base

**Pain points we solve:**
- Game day call overflow (impossible to staff for 3-hour spike)
- Lost orders when all lines are busy
- Inconsistent order accuracy under pressure

**Decision maker:** Owner or general manager

**Ideal profile:**
- Independent wing spots (not major franchises)
- Sports bar/restaurant hybrids
- High weekend/evening volume

---

### Tier 2: Secondary Targets

#### 4. Thai & Indian Restaurants
- High takeout/delivery percentage
- Complex menus with customizations
- Often owner-operated with limited staff

#### 5. Mexican Takeout & Taquerias
- High volume, quick-service model
- Often understaffed
- Language considerations for phone orders

#### 6. Sandwich/Sub Shops
- Lunch rush creates call bottlenecks
- High order customization (AI excels here)
- Competitive market needs efficiency edge

## Value Proposition Framework

### The 30-Second Pitch

> "I noticed you guys get pretty busy during dinner rush. Quick question—how many calls do you think you miss when everyone's slammed?
>
> Industry data shows restaurants miss about 43% of their calls during peak hours. That's real money walking out the door.
>
> We built an AI that answers your phone 24/7, takes orders perfectly every time, and sends them straight to your kitchen—no hold music, no missed calls. Restaurants using it are seeing 20-25% more phone orders.
>
> We're offering a free 2-week trial. No credit card, no commitment. If it doesn't work for you, you just turn it off. Can I show you a quick demo?"

### Value Proposition by Pain Point

| Pain Point | Our Solution | Proof Point |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| "We miss calls during rush" | AI answers every call, handles 10+ simultaneously | 87% reduction in missed calls |
| "Staff keeps quitting" | AI never quits, never calls in sick | Works 24/7/365, no turnover |
| "Orders come in wrong" | AI confirms every detail, 100% accuracy | Eliminates "I said NO onions" problems |
| "Can't find people to hire" | AI handles phones so staff can focus on food | Equivalent of 1-2 phone staff |
| "Phone ties up my best people" | Free up experienced staff for customers/kitchen | Reallocate labor to higher-value tasks |
| "We lose money on slow nights" | AI takes orders even when you're closed/slow | Capture advance orders anytime |

---

## Objection Handling

### "We're too busy to learn new technology"

> "I totally get it—that's exactly why we built this to be zero learning curve for your team. Orders just show up on a tablet, same as any other order. The AI does all the work. And honestly, that 'too busy' feeling is exactly the problem we solve. Let me show you in 5 minutes."

### "My customers want to talk to a real person"

> "That's a fair concern. Here's what we're seeing though—63% of customers actually prefer a quick, accurate order over waiting on hold. And when it's busy, they're not talking to a person anyway, they're listening to hold music or getting a busy signal. The AI answers instantly, every time. We can also set it up to transfer to you for special requests."

### "We tried something like this before and it didn't work"

> "I hear that a lot, honestly. Most of those older systems were frustrating—clunky menus, couldn't understand accents, got orders wrong. This is different. It's conversational AI—same technology as ChatGPT. It actually understands when someone says 'make it spicy' or 'no tomatoes.' Want to try calling the demo line right now and test it yourself?"

### "I don't have the budget right now"

> "That's exactly why we do the 2-week free trial—no cost, no credit card. Try it during your busiest week and see how many extra orders come in. Most restaurants cover the subscription cost in the first few days just from calls they would have missed. The ROI is usually obvious within a week."

### "I need to think about it"

> "Totally understand. What would help you decide? I can send you a link to our demo so you can call it and hear exactly what your customers would experience. Or if you want, I can set up the trial right now—takes about 10 minutes—and you can turn it off anytime if it's not working for you."

### "What if the AI makes mistakes?"

> "Great question. The AI reads back every order before confirming, and customers can correct anything on the spot. It's actually more consistent than staff because it never rushes, never mishears, never forgets to ask about drinks or sides. And you can always review orders before they go to the kitchen."

### "We don't get that many phone orders"

> "That might be because customers have given up calling. 69% of people say if they can't get through, they just don't order. Once you have a phone that always answers, you might be surprised how much phone volume comes back. Either way, the trial is free—let's find out together."

## Outreach Strategy

### Best Times to Contact

| Day | Best Times | Avoid |
|-----|------------|-------|
| Tuesday | 10-11 AM, 2-4 PM | 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM (lunch rush) |
| Wednesday | 10-11 AM, 2-4 PM | 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM |
| Thursday | 10-11 AM, 2-4 PM | Dinner prep starts ~4:30 PM |

**Worst days:** Friday, Saturday, Sunday (too busy), Monday (catching up from weekend)

### Outreach Channels (Priority Order)

#### 1. Walk-In Visits (Highest Conversion)
**Why it works:** Restaurant owners respect face-to-face, you can demo on the spot, shows you're local/invested.

**Script for walk-in:**
> "Hey, I'm [Name] from RestaurantAI. I'm not here to sell you anything today—I just wanted to drop off my card and ask a quick question. During your dinner rush, how many calls do you think you might be missing? [Let them answer]
>
> Yeah, industry data shows it's about 43% for most restaurants. We built something that might help. Can I leave you this card and maybe stop by Tuesday afternoon for a 10-minute demo?"

**What to bring:**
- Business cards
- One-page leave-behind (see appendix)
- Tablet with demo ready

---

#### 2. Phone Calls (Follow-up or Initial)
**Best for:** Following up after walk-in, reaching owners who aren't on-site

**Script:**
> "Hi, this is [Name] from RestaurantAI. Is [Owner Name] available?
>
> [If available] Hey [Owner], I'll keep this super quick—I know you're busy. We help restaurants like yours answer more phone calls and take more orders without hiring anyone. Right now we're offering a free 2-week trial. Would you have 10 minutes this week for a quick demo? I can come by whenever works for you."

---

#### 3. Email/Text (Supplement)
**Best for:** Owners who prefer written communication, follow-up after visit

**Subject line options:**
- "43% of your calls might be going unanswered"
- "Quick question about [Restaurant Name] phone orders"
- "Free trial - AI phone answering for [Restaurant Name]"

---

### The Demo

**Structure (10-15 minutes):**

1. **Pain discovery (2 min):** "How many phone orders do you get on a busy night? How many do you think you miss?"

2. **Live demo call (3 min):** "Let me call our demo line so you can hear exactly what your customers would experience." [Place order, show how it works]

3. **Dashboard walkthrough (3 min):** "Here's where orders show up. It's like getting a text with the order—nothing to learn."

4. **ROI calculation (2 min):** "If you're missing even 5 orders a night at $30 average, that's $150/night, $4,500/month. The service is $49/month."

5. **Trial close (2 min):** "Want to try it for 2 weeks? No credit card, no commitment. If it doesn't work, you just turn it off."
